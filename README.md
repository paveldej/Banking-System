## 🎯 Agile Methodology  
We worked in a **Scrum team**, with roles rotating mid-project for better learning and adaptability.  

🔄 **Sprints:** 8 sprints (1 per week)  
📅 **Sprint length:** 1 week  
📜 **Scrum Artifacts:**  
Throughout development, we used various Agile artifacts to track progress and improve efficiency. Examples include:  

- 📊 **Agile Earned Value Chart** – Used to measure project performance and progress over time.  
- 📈 **Graphs** – Visual representations of sprint progress and team velocity.  
- ⚠️ **Risk Management** – Identified potential risks and their mitigation strategies.  
- 📉 **Velocity Chart** – Tracked the team’s completed story points per sprint.  
- 📖 **User Manual** – A guide for users on how to navigate and use the banking system.  

🎯 **Meetings:** Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospective.
